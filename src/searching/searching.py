# TO-DO: Implement a recursive implementation of binary search
def binary_search(arr, target, start, end):
    # Your code here
    # find a midpoint
    #left & right pointers = start and end bc crazy
    #if targer is < midpoint, go left
        #recurse
    #elif taget == endpoint, return index

    # return target index


# STRETCH: implement an order-agnostic binary search
# This version of binary search should correctly find
# the target regardless of whether the input array is
# sorted in ascending order or in descending order
# You can implement this function either recursively
# or iteratively
